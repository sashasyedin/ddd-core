# ddd-core

This project contains functionality common to all .NET-, DDD- and Event Sourcing-based applications

## SeedWork

This folder contains custom base classes that can be used as a base for domain entities and value objects. Use these base classes so you don't have redundant code in each domain's object class. This is the type of copy and paste reuse that developers can share between projects, not a formal framework.
